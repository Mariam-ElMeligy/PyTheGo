# Deep Learning Optimization & Regularization Experiments

## 📋 Project Overview

This comprehensive experiment explores key aspects of deep learning model training through systematic comparisons of optimizers, batch sizes, regularization techniques, and early stopping strategies. The project provides practical insights into building robust neural networks for tabular data.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand the impact of different optimization algorithms
- Analyze the effects of batch size on training dynamics and generalization
- Evaluate regularization methods for preventing overfitting
- Implement and assess early stopping as an implicit regularizer
- Develop best practices for model architecture and training strategies

## 🧪 Experiments Conducted

### 1. Optimizer Comparison
**Compared:** SGD, SGD with Momentum, Adam
**Key Findings:**
- Adam converges fastest but with some instability
- SGD is more stable but prone to local minima
- SGD + Momentum performance depends heavily on parameter tuning

### 2. Batch Size Analysis  
**Tested:** Batch sizes [1, 32, 64, 128, 1024]
**Key Findings:**
- Smaller batches (1-32): Better generalization, noisier updates
- Medium batches (64-128): Optimal balance
- Large batches (1024+): Faster but poorer generalization

### 3. Regularization Methods
**Compared:** No regularization, L2 regularization, Dropout
**Key Findings:**
- Unregularized models show clear overfitting (3.27% generalization gap)
- L2 regularization reduces overfitting (0.74% gap)
- Dropout eliminates overfitting completely (-1.75% gap)

### 4. Early Stopping
**Compared:** Training with vs without early stopping
**Key Findings:**
- Without ES: 100 epochs, 1.42% overfitting gap
- With ES: 31 epochs, -0.60% gap (better generalization)
- 69% reduction in training time with better performance

## 📊 Key Results Summary

## 💡 Key Insights

### Optimization Strategy
1. **Use Adam as default optimizer** for fast convergence
2. **Consider SGD with decay** for potentially better generalization with tuning

### Batch Size Selection
1. **Batch size 32-128** provides best balance
2. **Smaller batches** act as implicit regularizers
3. **Larger batches** speed up training but may overfit

### Regularization Approach  
1. **Dropout is most effective** for deep networks
2. **Combine L2 + Dropout** for robust overfitting prevention
3. **Early stopping is essential** for efficiency and performance

### Training Best Practices
1. **Always use validation set** for monitoring
2. **Implement early stopping** with patience 5-10
3. **Use proper data splits** (70/15/15 recommended)

## 🎯 Recommended Setup for New Projects

```python
# Optimal configuration for tabular data
config = {
    'optimizer': Adam(learning_rate=0.001),
    'batch_size': 64,
    'regularization': 'l2 + dropout',
    'early_stopping': True,
    'patience': 10,
    'data_split': [0.7, 0.15, 0.15]
}
```

## 📚 Lessons Learned

1. **No silver bullet**: Different techniques work best in different scenarios
2. **Regularization is cumulative**: Combining methods often works best  
3. **Validation is crucial**: Proper evaluation prevents false confidence
4. **Efficiency matters**: Early stopping provides massive computational savings
5. **Generalization over memorization**: The ultimate goal of all techniques

## 🔮 Future Work

- Experiment with learning rate schedules
- Test on different dataset types (images, text)
- Explore advanced optimizers (AdamW, Nadam)
- Implement learning rate finder
- Add cross-validation strategies

# Python Practice Archive 🐍

This repository contains various Python practice tasks, mini and full pipeline projects.

## Structure

- `Task1_bankingI/` – Simple Bank Simulation project

- `Task2_bankingII/` – Simple Bank simulation Project (using OOP Concepts)

- `Task3_Pandas_practice/` – Different-level questions to build intuitive about the famous python library

- `Workshop_Data_Preprocessing_&_Visualization/` – Comperhensive Workshop with full Data Analysis Pipeline

- `Regression_Task` - linear, multiple, polynomial Regression + full pipeline Machine learning project

- `Classifcation_Task` -
 a medical condition binary classification model (presence or absence) using machine learning techniques. The goal is to achieve high generalization while minimizing critical errors, especially false negatives, to ensure timely medical diagnoses. 

- `Ml_Project` - (Mushroom Edibility Classification) 
99.8% accurate ML pipeline classifying edible vs. poisonous mushrooms using odor, gill traits, and spore prints. Features robust preprocessing, imbalance handling, and deployment-ready serialized models.

- `Bank Marketing Classification` - 
96%+ AUC model predicting term deposit subscriptions using gradient boosting (XGBoost, CatBoost). Enables targeted campaigns with dual preprocessing pipelines and class imbalance handling.

- `Income Prediction DLModel` 
Deep learning classifier predicting >$50K income from census data. Achieves 86.3% accuracy using embedding layers for categorical features. Built with TensorFlow/Keras.

- `Deep Learning Optimization & Regularization Experiments`
A comprehensive deep learning experiment comparing optimization strategies and regularization techniques. Systematically evaluates optimizers, batch sizes, dropout, L2 regularization, and early stopping to identify best practices for training robust neural networks on tabular data.

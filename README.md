# Python Practice Archive üêç

This repository contains various Python practice tasks and mini-projects.

## Structure

- `Task1_bankingI/` ‚Äì Simple Bank Simulation project

- `Task2_bankingII/` ‚Äì Simple Bank simulation Project (using OOP Concepts)

- `Task3_Pandas_practice/` ‚Äì Different-level questions to build intuitive about the famous python library

- `Workshop_Data_Preprocessing_&_Visualization/` ‚Äì Comperhensive Workshop with full Data Analysis Pipeline

- `Regression_Task` - linear, multiple, polynomial Regression + full pipeline Machine learning project

- `Classifcation_Task` - a binary classification model to predict the presence or absence of a medical condition using machine learning techniques. The goal is to achieve high generalization while minimizing critical errors, especially false negatives, to ensure timely medical diagnoses. 

- `Ml_Project` - (Mushroom Edibility Classification): End-to-end ML pipeline achieving 99.8% accuracy in classifying mushrooms as edible or poisonous. Includes robust preprocessing, imbalance handling, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning across 6 algorithms. Key features like odor, gill traits, and spore print color drive interpretability and model performance + Deployment-ready pipeline with serialized model for seamless real-world predictions.
